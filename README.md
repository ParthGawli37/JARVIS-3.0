# JARVIS-3.0
bro all functions are working but,
whatsapps function is having problem,
can you check it.
And check the face_test file it a program that is a modfiy ver.. of takeCommand function in which the takeCommand will start once the face is recognize, and it will greet you according to the image of person of whose name is saved on.
so what do you think about it.
face_test file i wanted to firt test it before adding in give me your opinion on it,\. 
and the datebase modification i think it will be great to store output as will because all the Jarvis output talk are going to waste it will good to store it.
I know it a lot but it is still hard for me
